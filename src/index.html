        <strong style="font-size:20px; color: skyblue">The city of gold</strong><br><br>Johannesburg is not only known as the business hub of South Africa but also aptly known
         as the City of Gold for good reason. Johannesburg is built right on top of one of the biggest natural goldfields known to man.
          Word spread fast and prospectors from all over the globe came to Johannesburg to try their luck at mining in the Witwatersrand area. 
          It is widely believed that the Struben brothers were the first pioneers to actually find gold - but their luck quickly ran out.

            <strong style="font-size:20px; color: skyblue">The great wall</strong><br><br>The Great Hall, which is also managed by the
             Performing Arts Administration seats up to 1030, has a rich heritage that dates back to the world premiere of the SA musical, King 
             Kong and beyond. In 1993 we hosted the St. Petersburg Ballet Company. In 1979 the Great Hall was refurbished - it was given a new 
             acoustic treatment, an inner stage and a wide forestage with an hydraulic orchestra lift.
            For many decades the Johannesburg Musical Society has presented its splendid recitals, featuring the best artists from this country and all 
            over the world, here. Today many students all of the world come to wits to further their studies and the maintenance of this building is
            exceptional. This site was indeed worthy to behold.

            <strong style="font-size:20px; color: skyblue">Table Mountain</strong><br><br>The World famous Table Mountain is part of the sceni
            c Peninsula Mountain chain that stretches from Signal Hill in the North (rightmost peak in the image above) to Cape Point in the South,
             some 60km. Around it are many beautiful Valleys, Bays and Beaches bound by the cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean in the West and the warm
              waters of False Bay in the East. It is a World Heritage Site because of its unique flora and fauna. This province is however very cold, 
              it remains moderately chilly even in the summer season, we stayed here long enough to experience this tumultous weather. Stepping into
               Cape Town always seems as if you're stepping to a new country outside SA. What a Lovely cold province!
